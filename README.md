## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Python** 3.8+
- **Git** for version control
- **Google Gemini API Key** (for AI recommendations)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AI-Mens-Hairstyle-Recommender
```

### 2. Set Up Backend
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API Keys
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# Required for AI-powered recommendations
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional for image generation
STABILITY_AI_API_KEY=your_stability_ai_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Development settings
DEBUG=True
```

**Getting Google Gemini API Key:**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key to your `.env` file

### 4. Set Up Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Create .env.local file:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 5. Run the Application

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
# From backend directory
# On Windows:
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here && python app/main.py
# On macOS/Linux:
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here && python app/main.py
# Backend runs on http://localhost:8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
# From frontend directory
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### 6. Access the App
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üß™ Testing the LLM Integration

To verify the AI integration is working:

```bash
# From backend directory
python test_api.py
```

This will test:
- Server health and LLM status
- AI-powered recommendation generation
- API endpoint functionality

## üì± How It Works

### Step 1: Create Profile (Enhanced)
- Enter demographic information (age, ethnicity, gender)
- Specify hair texture preferences
- AI uses this data for personalized recommendations

### Step 2: Upload Photo
- Drag & drop or select a clear front-facing photo
- Supports JPG, PNG, WebP formats
- Automatic image validation and processing

### Step 3: Face Analysis
- AI detects facial landmarks and features
- Determines face shape with confidence scoring
- Visualizes detected points on your photo

### Step 4: AI Recommendations (NEW)
- **Google Gemini analyzes your complete profile**
- Considers face shape, age, ethnicity, and preferences
- Generates culturally-aware, personalized suggestions
- Shows 6 diverse, AI-curated hairstyles

### Step 5: Virtual Try-On
- AI generates realistic preview of chosen hairstyle
- Download or share your new look
- Try multiple styles with easy regeneration

## üé® AI-Generated Hairstyle Recommendations

The Gemini LLM considers:

- **Face Shape** - Oval, round, square, heart, long proportions
- **Age** - Age-appropriate styling suggestions
- **Ethnicity** - Culturally authentic and appropriate styles
- **Hair Texture** - Straight, wavy, curly, coily compatibility
- **Lifestyle** - Professional, casual, trendy preferences
- **Maintenance** - Low to high-maintenance options

Sample AI-generated styles include:
- **Professional Fade Variations** - Tailored to face shape
- **Cultural Authenticity** - Styles respecting heritage
- **Age-Appropriate Trends** - Modern but suitable
- **Texture-Specific Cuts** - Optimized for hair type
- **Lifestyle Matching** - Professional vs. casual options

## üîß Configuration

### LLM Prompt Customization
Modify the prompt template in `backend/services/llm_hairstyle_recommender.py`:

```python
def _setup_prompt_template(self):
    # Customize the prompt for different recommendation styles
    template = """You are a professional hairstylist AI assistant..."""
```

### Fallback Behavior
The system automatically:
- Uses traditional recommendations if Gemini API is unavailable
- Provides graceful degradation of service
- Logs LLM status in health check endpoint

### Traditional Mode
To disable LLM and use rule-based recommendations:
- Remove or comment out `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`
- The system will automatically use the traditional recommender

## üìù API Endpoints

### Enhanced Endpoints
- `GET /` - Health check with LLM status
- `POST /recommend-hairstyles/` - AI-powered or traditional recommendations
- `POST /analyze-face/` - Facial analysis with profile integration
- `POST /generate-hairstyle-image/` - AI image generation
- `POST /create-profile/` - User profile management

### New Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "AI Hairstyle Recommender & Visualizer", 
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "llm_enabled": true,
  "features": [
    "Google Gemini AI-powered recommendations",
