# 🪞 Virtual Try-On Feature

This document explains the new **Virtual Try-On** feature that allows users to see themselves with different hairstyles using AI image generation.

## ✨ What's New

The system now generates **personalized images** of users with their chosen hairstyles instead of generic hairstyle examples. Users can upload their photo and see exactly how different hairstyles would look on them.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **User Journey**
1. **Upload Photo** → User uploads their image for face analysis
2. **Face Analysis** → AI analyzes facial features and determines face shape
3. **Hairstyle Recommendations** → AI suggests suitable hairstyles based on user profile
4. **Virtual Try-On** → User selects a hairstyle and generates personalized image

### 2. **Technical Implementation**

#### Backend (`LLMHairstyleRecommender`)
- **Enhanced `generate_hairstyle_image()` method** accepts user images as base64 input
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation** processes both user image and hairstyle prompt
- **Multimodal prompt engineering** preserves user's facial features while applying new hairstyles
- **Fallback support** for generic hairstyle generation when no user image is provided

#### Frontend (`GeneratedImageView`)
- **Automatic base64 conversion** of user uploaded images
- **Seamless integration** with existing image upload flow
- **Updated UI messaging** to reflect virtual try-on functionality
- **Error handling** with meaningful feedback

## 🎯 Key Features

### **Personalized Results**
- Preserves user's facial features, skin tone, and appearance
- Only changes the hairstyle while maintaining photo quality
- Generates photorealistic results with proper lighting

### **Advanced AI Prompting**
```
Create a realistic image of this person with the following hairstyle: {hairstyle_description}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Keep the person's facial features, skin tone, and overall appearance exactly the same
- Only change the hairstyle to match the description
- Maintain the same photo quality and lighting
- Ensure the new hairstyle looks natural and professionally styled
- The hairstyle should complement the person's face shape and features
- Generate a high-quality, photorealistic result
```

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Still supports generic hairstyle generation for recommendations
- Maintains existing API structure
- No breaking changes to frontend or backend

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **API Integration**
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`
- **Input**: User image (base64) + hairstyle description
- **Output**: Base64-encoded PNG image as data URL
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to placeholder images

### **Image Processing**
- **Maximum input size**: 7 MB per image
- **Supported formats**: PNG, JPEG, WebP
- **Input format**: Base64 data URLs or raw base64 strings
- **Output format**: `data:image/png;base64,{image_data}`

### **Frontend Integration**
```javascript
// User images are automatically converted to base64
const base64Images = await Promise.all(imagePromises)

// Sent to backend for virtual try-on
const response = await apiService.generateHairstyleImage({
  user_images: base64Images,
  hairstyle_id: hairstyle.id,
  gender: userProfile?.gender,
})
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test the Feature**
```bash
# Run the virtual try-on test
python test_virtual_tryon.py
```

### **Test Coverage**
- ✅ Generic hairstyle generation (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Virtual try-on with user images
- ✅ Data URL format handling
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Base64 encoding/decoding

## 📊 Performance

### **Generation Time**
- **Average**: 3-5 seconds per image
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds maximum
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple styles can be generated simultaneously

### **Image Quality**
- **Resolution**: High-quality output suitable for download/sharing
- **Realism**: Photorealistic results with proper lighting and shadows
- **Consistency**: Maintains user's appearance while changing hairstyle

## 🎨 User Experience

### **Before (Generic Images)**
- Users saw generic hairstyle examples
- No personalization or face-specific results
- Limited engagement with recommendations

### **After (Virtual Try-On)**
- Users see themselves with the recommended hairstyles
- Personalized results based on their actual photo
- Higher engagement and better decision-making
- Download and share capabilities for generated images

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### **Data Handling**
- User images are processed temporarily for generation
- No permanent storage of user photos
- Images are transmitted securely via HTTPS
- Base64 encoding ensures data integrity

### **API Security**
- Gemini API key management through environment variables
- Request timeout limits prevent hanging connections
- Error handling prevents sensitive information exposure

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Multiple angles**: Generate front, side, and back views
2. **Hair color variations**: Allow users to try different colors
3. **Styling options**: Show different styling approaches for same cut
4. **Before/after comparison**: Side-by-side comparison view
5. **Batch processing**: Generate multiple hairstyles at once

### **Technical Optimizations**
1. **Caching**: Cache generated images for repeated requests
2. **Image compression**: Optimize file sizes for faster loading
3. **Progressive loading**: Show low-res preview while generating
4. **Background generation**: Pre-generate popular combinations

## 📱 Mobile Compatibility

### **Responsive Design**
- Works on mobile devices and tablets
- Touch-friendly interface for image selection
- Optimized image sizes for mobile networks
- Progressive web app features for offline capability

## 🔄 Integration Points
